# HopKiddo

Overview: Ultimately, HopKiddo will serve as an awesome way to help RSP and General Education Teachers actively implement kiddos’ IEP accommodations and creative a more engaging learning environment for kiddos with special needs.


Features:
1) Visual Timer + Hoptivities
- Great for kiddos who require a little break (according to their IEPs) 
- Will include clickable Hoptivity options (mini games, digital painting, coding exercises, note/journal writing, etc.)

2) Customizable Hop-ups
- If a kiddo gets stuck on an assignment or clicks on things she or he shouldn’t be on, a pop-up will appear with a phrase, quote, or picture that is motivating/encouraging to her or him
- An excellent way for teachers, parents, and kiddos to work together to provide a meaningful individual learning experience
*Example Hop-up: “Hey Sean, Remember that your mom will take you to see a movie of your choice [ PG of course :) ] this weekend if you earn an 80% or above on all your assignments this week. Let Ms. T or your study buddy, Kierra, know if you need any help.”

3) IEP Goal Tracking
- This feature will allow RSP and General Education teachers to better communicate with each other and with parents in real time about each kiddo’s progress to meeting the academic and/or behavioral goals detailed in her or his IEP
- Will provide visual representations of kiddo’s progress (clickable pie charts), research-based suggestions on ways to increase mastery of state standards, and ideas for additional projects-based learning opportunities
